## Ansible

* **Introduction to Ansible**
    * Ansible is an IT automation tool.
    * It is free and open-source.
    * It is a powerful tool that can be used to automate a wide variety of tasks, including configuration management, application deployment, and infrastructure management.
* **Benefits of Using Ansible**
    * Saves time and reduces errors by automating repetitive tasks.
    * Makes it easy to manage large numbers of systems.
    * Can be used to integrate with other tools, such as Docker, Kubernetes, and AWS.
* **Getting Started with Ansible**
    * Ansible playbooks are YAML files that define the tasks that Ansible will execute.
    * Playbooks can be run on multiple servers at the same time.
    * Ansible is agentless, which means that it does not require any software to be installed on the servers that it manages.

---

To start, you'll need one server where Ansible will be installed and configured. This server will connect to other remote servers for automation tasks.

### Step 1: Install Ansible on the Main Server

1. **Install Ansible:**
   - Follow the steps outlined in the official documentation [here](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/installation_guide/index.html) to install Ansible on your main server.

2. **Verify Ansible Installation:**
   - After installation, check the Ansible version:
     ```bash
     ansible --version
     ```

3. **Test Ansible Connectivity:**
   - Ensure Ansible is functioning correctly:
     ```bash
     ansible localhost -m ping
     ```

### Step 2: Set Up Connectivity with Remote Servers

1. **Check SSH Connectivity:**
   - Verify connectivity between Ansible and remote servers:
     ```bash
     ssh root@remote_server_ip
     ```
   - Enter the password when prompted. Ensure port 22 is open on the remote server.

2. **Configure Passwordless SSH Authentication:**
   - Generate an SSH key on the Ansible server:
     ```bash
     ssh-keygen
     ```
   - Copy the SSH key to the remote server:
     ```bash
     ssh-copy-id <remote_server_ip>
     ```
   - Enter the password when prompted. You should now be able to SSH into the remote server without entering a password. Check using `ssh root@remote_server_ip`.

### Step 3: Configure Ansible

1. **Navigate to Ansible Configuration Files:**
   - Ansible configuration files are located at:
     ```bash
     /etc/ansible/ansible.cfg
     /etc/ansible/hosts
     ```
   - Navigate to the `/etc/ansible` directory and inspect the configuration files.

2. **Generate Example Configuration File:**
   - Initialize a new `ansible.cfg` file with default settings commented out:
     ```bash
     ansible-config init --disabled -t all > ansible.cfg
     ```
   - This will provide multiple options with default examples for reference.

### Step 4: Create and Run Your First Playbook

1. **Create Playbook Directory:**
   - Create a directory to store your playbooks:
     ```bash
     mkdir playbooks
     cd playbooks/
     ```

2. **Create Your First Playbook:**
   - Playbooks are written in YAML format. YAML file starts with `---`. Formatting/indentation matters in YAML files.
You can provide the description using `- name`. 
Begin with a basic playbook:
     ```bash
     vi first_pb.yml
     ```
     ```yaml
     ---
     - name: First Basic PB
       hosts: localhost
       
       tasks:
       - name: Test Connectivity
         ping:
     ```

3. **Run Your Playbook:**
   - Execute the playbook using `ansible-playbook`:
     ```bash
     ansible-playbook first_pb.yml
     ```

4. **Check Playbook Syntax:**
   - Ensure your YAML syntax is correct:
     ```bash
     ansible-playbook --syntax-check first_pb.yml
     ```

### Step 5: Create a Playbook for Installing and Starting a Package

1. **Example Playbook for CentOS (using `yum` module):**
   - Create a playbook (`app_install.yml`) to install and start a package (e.g., nginx):
     ```bash
     vi app_install.yml
     ```
     ```yaml
     ---
     - name: Install and Start the service
       hosts: localhost
     
       tasks:
       - name: Installing nginx 
         yum:
           name: nginx 
           state: present
       - name: Starting the nginx service 
         service:
           name: nginx 
           state: started 
           enabled: true
     ```

### Overview of Ansible Playbook:

```yaml
---
- name: Install and start Nginx
  hosts: webservers  # Assuming 'webservers' is defined in your Ansible inventory 
  become: true  # Tasks should be run with sudo privileges

  tasks:
  - name: Install Nginx 
    yum:  # Using the yum module for package management
      name: nginx  # Name of the package 
      state: present  # Ensure the package is installed

  - name: Start Nginx 
    service:  # Using the service module to manage the service
      name: nginx 
      state: started
      enabled: true  # Ensure Nginx is enabled to start on boot
```

**Index of all Ansible Modules**: [Official Documentation](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/collections/index_module.html)

### Playbook for Remote Server

To provide inventory of remote servers, navigate to the configuration directory of Ansible.

```bash
cd /etc/ansible
```

When listing files, you will find the `hosts` file in this directory. You can directly add IPs of remote servers under the `Ungrouped hosts` list in this file. Alternatively, create a `Grouped hosts` section inside this `hosts` file to group a set of IPs.

**Adding a remote IP in the Ungrouped hosts list:**

```bash
[root@centos1 ansible]# vi hosts
...
...
# Example of Ungrouped hosts, specify before any group headers:
10.211.55.5
## green.example.com
## blue.example.com
## 192.168.100.1
## 192.168.100.10
...
...
```

After saving the `hosts` file, verify if it's properly inserted using `ansible-inventory --list`.

```bash
[root@centos01 ansible]# ansible-inventory --list
{
    "_meta": {
        "hostvars": {}
    },
    "all": {
        "children": [
            "ungrouped"
        ]
    },
    "ungrouped": {
        "hosts": [
            "10.211.55.5"
        ]
    }
}
[root@centos01 ansible]#
```

Verify if the Ansible server can connect to the remote server using `ansible all -m ping`.

```bash
[root@centos01 ansible]# ansible all -m ping
10.211.55.5 | SUCCESS => {
    "ansible_facts": {
        "discovered_interpreter_python": "/usr/bin/python3"
    },
    "changed": false,
    "ping": "pong"
}
[root@centos01 ansible]#
```

To specify remote IPs in a playbook, use `hosts: all` to include all servers listed in the host file. If using grouped hosts, specify the group name like `hosts: webservers`.

**Example:**

```bash
vi first_pb.yml
```
```yaml
---
- name: First Basic PB
  hosts: all
  
  tasks:
  - name: Test Connectivity
    ping:
```

Run the playbook:

```bash
ansible-playbook first_pb.yml
```

### Copying files to Remote Server

```bash
vi 02_copy_files.yml
```
```yaml
---
- name: Copying files to remote
  hosts: all

  tasks:
  - name: Copy files
    copy:
      src: /root/myfile.txt
      dest: /tmp/
```

When you run this playbook, it copies the file to the remote server with the same permissions and file ownership. You can modify these settings by adding `owner`, `group`, and `mode`.

```yaml
---
- name: Copying files to remote
  hosts: all

  tasks:
  - name: Copy files
    copy:
      src: /root/myfile.txt
      dest: /tmp/
      owner: paul
      group: paul
      mode: "0777"
```

### Backup of Files on Remote Server

If you make changes to the file `myfile.txt` on the Ansible server and run the playbook again, it will overwrite the existing file on the remote server. To keep a backup of the old file when copying the updated file to the remote server, use the `backup` option.

```yaml
---
- name: Copying files to remote
  hosts: all

  tasks:
  - name: Copy files
    copy:
      src: /root/myfile.txt
      dest: /tmp/
      owner: paul
      group: paul
      mode: ugo=rw
      backup: true
```

When you run the Ansible playbook, it copies the file to the remote server while creating a backup of the existing file with an updated filename.

Example output on the remote server:
```
- rw-rw-rw-. 1 paul paul 12 Feb 8 17:29 myfile.txt.47862.2024-02-080
-rw-rw-rw-. 1 paul paul 19 Feb 8 17:31 myfile.txt
```

### Ansible File Module: Create, Delete, and Set Permissions on Remote Server

**To Create a File:**

```yaml
---
- name: File Module
  hosts: all

  tasks:
  - name: Creating a file 
    file:
      path: /tmp/newfile.txt
      state: touch 
      owner: paul 
      group: paul
      mode: u=rwx,g=rw,o=r
```

**To Create a Directory:**

```yaml
---
- name: File Module
  hosts: all

  tasks:
  - name: Creating a directory 
    file:
      path: /tmp/myfolder
      state: directory
```

**To Delete a File/Directory:** Use `state: absent` for both file and directory.

```yaml
---
- name: File Module
  hosts: all

  tasks:
  - name: Deleting a file 
    file:
      path: /tmp/newfile.txt
      state: absent

  - name: Deleting a directory 
    file:
      path: /tmp/myfolder
      state: absent
```

### Run Script Remotely

Assume there is a script `test.sh` on the remote server with executable permissions.

```bash
vi test.sh
```

```bash
#!/bin/bash

echo "Hey buddy"
touch /tmp/script/testscriptfile
```

To run this script remotely using Ansible, write a playbook.

```yaml
---
- name: Run a script 
  hosts: all
  
  tasks:
  - name: Run script
    shell: /tmp/script/test.sh
```

When this playbook runs, it executes `test.sh` on the remote server. However, if you want to capture the script's output, such as the `echo` statement, you can redirect the output to a file on the remote server either by modifying `test.sh` or by adjusting the playbook.

Modify the playbook to redirect the output to `test.log`.

```yaml
---
- name: Run a script 
  hosts: all

  tasks:
  - name: Run script 
    shell: /tmp/script/test.sh >> test.log
    args:
      chdir: /tmp/script/
      creates: test.log
```

In this playbook:
- `args` are provided to change the directory (`chdir`) to `/tmp/script/`.
- It creates the `test.log` file if it doesn't exist (`creates`).
- It runs the shell script `/tmp/script/test.sh` and appends (`>>`) the output to `test.log`.

### Adding Cronjob Remotely

Create a playbook to add a cron job:

```yaml
---
- name: Cron Setup
  hosts: all

  tasks:
  - name: Add Cron Job 
    cron:
      name: Run Test Script 
      minute: 30
      hour: 18
      day: 15
      month: "*"
      weekday: "*" 
      user: paul 
      job: /tmp/script/test.sh
```

When executed, this playbook adds a cron job entry on the remote server.

**Disabling the Cronjob**

To disable a cronjob, include `disabled: yes` in the playbook. This comments out the cron job entry on the remote server.

```yaml
---
- name: Cron Setup
  hosts: all

  tasks:
  - name: Add Cron Job 
    cron:
      name: Run Test Script 
      minute: 30
      hour: 18
      day: 15
      month: "*"
      weekday: "*" 
      user: paul 
      job: /tmp/script/test.sh
      disabled: yes
```

**Using Environmental Variables in Cronjob**

To set an environmental variable (`PATH="/tmp/script/"`) in a cronjob, use the following playbook:

```yaml
---
- name: Modify Cron
  hosts: all

  tasks:
  - name: Modify Cron Job
    cron:
      name: PATH
      env: yes 
      user: paul 
      job: /tmp/script/
```

To insert a variable (`VAR`) before or after another variable (`PATH`), adjust `insertbefore` or `insertafter` accordingly.

```yaml
---
- name: Modify Cron
  hosts: all

  tasks:
  - name: Modify Cron Job
    cron:
      name: VAR
      env: yes 
      user: paul 
      job: /tmp/script/
      insertbefore: PATH
```

To remove a variable from the cronjob, use `state: absent`.

```yaml
---
- name: Cron Setup
  hosts: all

  tasks:
  - name: Remove Cron Job
    cron:
      name: Run Test Script
      user: paul
      state: absent
```

### Create User on Remote Server

Create a playbook to manage user creation:

```yaml
---
- name: User Management
  hosts: all

  tasks:
  - name: User Creation
    user:
      name: nick
      comment: New user for QA Team
      home: /home/nick # Optional, by default it creates /home/nick directory, if you want custom home directory, use this.
      shell: /bin/bash # Assign default shell
```

To add the user in one group, you can use `group: QA`. To add the user in multiple groups, you can use `groups: nick,QA,automation`.

```yaml
---
- name: User Management
  hosts: all

  tasks:
  - name: User Creation
    user:
      name: nick
      comment: New user for QA Team
      shell: /bin/bash
      groups: nick,QA,automation
```

To delete a user and optionally remove associated data/home directory, use `state: absent` and `remove: yes`.

```yaml
---
- name: User Management
  hosts: all

  tasks:
  - name: User Deletion
    user:
      name: nick
      comment: New user for QA Team
      shell: /bin/bash
      groups: nick,QA,automation
      state: absent
      remove: yes
```

### Add or Update Password

To set a password for a user, use the `user` module in Ansible.

```yaml
---
- name: Set Password
  hosts: all

  tasks:
  - name: Set password 
    user:
      name: nick
      update_password: always
      password: "{{ 'abcd123' | password_hash('sha512') }}"
```

Use `update_password: oncreate` to update the password only during user creation. For existing users, use `update_password: always`.

You can't just provide the password in simple text format. Passwords must be encrypted using a hash function like `password_hash('sha512')` for security reasons.

### Find and Stop Process

Check if your remote server has the nginx server running:
```
systemctl status nginx
```
If you want to kill the process, you can obtain the PID using `pgrep nginx`. To kill the process, use:
```
pgrep nginx | xargs kill
```
This is a manual process; you can integrate this command into an Ansible playbook to manage the service.

Create a playbook on the Ansible server to terminate a process using the `shell` module and another task to start the service using the `service` module.

```yaml
---
- name: Kill a process 
  hosts: all

  tasks:
  - name: Find a process and kill it 
    ignore_errors: yes
    shell: "pgrep nginx | xargs kill"

  - name: Start the service 
    service:
      name: nginx 
      state: started
```
The `ignore_errors: yes` parameter allows the playbook to continue even if the process is not found.

### Download Files from the Internet on Remote Server

```yaml
---
- name: Download files
  hosts: all

  tasks:
  - name: Download file 
    get_url:
      url: https://www.python.org/ftp/python/3.12.2/Python-3.12.2.tar.xz
      dest: /tmp/script/ 
      owner: paul 
      group: paul 
      mode: '0777'
```
You can specify `owner`, `group`, and `mode` to ensure the downloaded file has appropriate permissions.

### Enable Firewall Service or Port

```yaml
---
- name: Firewall changes
  hosts: all

  tasks:
  - name: Enable a service in firewalld
    firewalld:
      port: 80/tcp  # Specify protocol (tcp/udp) after port number
      permanent: true 
      state: enabled

  - name: Reload the firewalld
    service:
      name: firewalld 
      state: reloaded
```
Use the actual service name instead of `port` if it's a known service. For example: `service: nginx`. To list all existing services you can use `firewall-cmd --get-services`.

`permanent: true` ensures changes persist across reboots.

Also need to restart the serice once you make any changes in firewalld, you can use `service` module for the same.

### Run Playbook Tasks as a SUDO User

On the Ansible server, all playbooks have been created and executed using the **root** user. When a non-root user like **paul** attempts to run the playbook, authentication fails because passwordless authentication was set up only for the **root** user.

To enable **paul** to run playbooks, follow the same steps used for the **root** user. Log into the Ansible server as **paul**, generate keys with `ssh-keygen`, and copy the key to the remote server using `ssh-copy-id paul@<remote_server_ip>`. Enter the password when prompted. This setup allows **paul** to execute playbooks on the remote server.

However, executing playbooks that require sudo privileges (e.g., tasks to enable/disable firewalld services) fails for **paul**. In such cases, add `become: true` at the task or playbook level to escalate privileges, essentially **becoming root** while running the playbook.

```yaml
---
- name: Firewall changes
  hosts: all
  become: true

  tasks:
  - name: Enable a service in firewalld
    firewalld:
      port: 80/tcp  # Specify protocol (tcp/udp) after port number
      permanent: true 
      state: enabled

  - name: Reload the firewalld
    service:
      name: firewalld 
      state: reloaded
```
To run a playbook that requires **becoming root**, use `--ask-become-pass` to provide the sudo password. Otherwise, you'll encounter an error: `FAILED! => {"msg": "Missing sudo password"}`.

```
[paul@centos01 playbooks]$ ansible-playbook --ask-become-pass 12_firewalld.yml
BECOME password:
```
