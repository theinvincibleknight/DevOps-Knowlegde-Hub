# Docker

**What is a Docker?**
- Docker is a containerization platform for developing, packaging, shipping, and running applications.
- It provides the ability to run an application in an isolated environment called a container.
- Makes deployment and development efficient.

**What is a Container?**
- A way to package an application with all the necessary dependencies and configuration.
- It can be easily shared
- Makes deployment and development efficient.

**Main Components of Docker**

- **Docker File:** It is a simple text file with instructions to build an image.
- **Docker Image:** Single File with all the dep and lib to run the
program.
- **Docker Containers:** Instance of an image.
- **Docker Registry:** A Docker registry is a central repository for storing and distributing Docker images.
    - **Registry**: A Docker Registry is a service that stores Docker images. It acts as a storage and distribution mechanism for Docker images. Developers can push (upload) and pull (download) Docker images to and from registries.
    - **Repository**: A Docker Repository is a collection of related Docker images, often with different versions of the same application or service. Within a Docker Registry, repositories organize images. Each repository can contain multiple image versions, identified by tags (e.g., `nginx:latest`, `nginx:1.19`, etc.).

The Docker Registry is where Docker images are physically stored. Docker Repositories organize related images within a registry, making it easier to manage and distribute different versions of applications or services.

### **Docker Engine Installation on Linux**

To install the Docker Engine on RedHat/CentOS, you can use the following commands:

Using CentOS repository, we can install Docker Engine on RedHat. First, we need to set up the repository.

**Set up the repository**

```
[root@redhat01 ~]# lscpu | more      # Check the architecture
[root@redhat01 ~]# sudo yum install -y yum-utils
[root@redhat01 ~]# sudo yum-config-manager --add-repo https://download.docker.com/linux/centos/docker-ce.repo
```

**Install Docker Engine**

To install the latest version, run:
```
[root@redhat01 ~]# sudo yum install docker-ce docker-ce-cli containerd.io docker-buildx-plugin docker-compose-plugin
[root@redhat01 ~]# systemctl start docker.service
[root@redhat01 ~]# systemctl status docker.service
[root@redhat01 ~]# docker -v
[root@redhat01 ~]# docker ps
```

Install Docker Engine on other supported platforms: [Official Documentation](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/)

### Creating DEMO Project - React Webpp

**Prerequisites:** <br>
Install Node.js and Visual Studio Code on your system. (Mac in this example)

Now open VS Code. Open the folder where you want to create this project and open the integrated terminal.
```
# node -v                           # Check Node.js version
v20.9.0
# npx create-react-app testapp      # Create a React-based application
Need to install the following packages:
create-react-app@5.0.1
Ok to proceed? (y)
```
This will create a new folder named testapp in your project directory, and all application files will be inside this testapp folder.

```
$ cd testapp        # Change directory to testapp
$ npm start         # Run the application
Compiled successfully!
You can now view testapp in the browser.

Local:              http://localhost:3000
On Your Network:    http://192.168.1.128:3000

Note that the development build is not optimized.
To create a production build, use npm run build.

webpack compiled successfully.
```
You can view the application in the browser using the link provided in the output. To **stop** the project, press `Ctrl+C`.

To run this application successfully, the app needs `node_modules` which will be saved in the **testapp** folder. If this folder is not available, you can run `npm install` to get these node modules and then run `npm start`.

Only main files are deployed while deploying the application; **node_modules** are not deployed. To obtain all the required node modules, use `npm install`, and then run it.

### Creating a Dockerfile

Create a new file named `Dockerfile` in testapp. You can also install the Docker extension in VS Code for easy Dockerfile creation.

```
FROM node:20

WORKDIR /myapp

COPY . .

RUN npm install

EXPOSE 3000

CMD ["npm", "start"]
```
**`FROM node:20`** : You need to specify a base for the image. Since this is a web app, you can use **node** as a base image. When you use `FROM node`, it retrieves the latest image from the Docker Registry. If you want to specify a particular version, you need to provide the tag name along with the image, such as `FROM node:20`. You can find available versions on the Docker repository.

**`WORKDIR /myapp`** : By default, when this Dockerfile creates a container from the image, it starts in an empty directory. You need to set a working directory where you want to run the application. This command creates a folder named **myapp** inside the container and sets it as the working directory.

**`COPY . .`** : Since this Dockerfile is in your local **testapp** folder, you need to copy all files from the current directory on your system to the container's working directory. Since you have set the working directory as **/myapp**, you can directly use `COPY . .`. Alternatively, you can specify the source directory explicitly: `COPY . /myapp`.

**`RUN npm install`** : To run the web app, the container needs the `node_modules` folder. After copying all main files to the working directory, you need to run `npm install` inside the container to install the required node modules.

**`EXPOSE 3000`** : Node.js applications typically listen on port 3000 by default. You can specify this port for the application to listen on by using the `EXPOSE` command in the Dockerfile.

**`CMD ["npm", "start"]`** : The Dockerfile is used to create an image, not to run the application directly. So you can't use `RUN npm start`. Therefore, you specify the command to start your application inside the container using `CMD`. In this example, it's `npm start`. Commands are passed in the form of arrays inside double quotes and separated by commas in the `CMD` instruction.
