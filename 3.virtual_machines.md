## Understanding Virtual Machines

**Analogy: Efficient Land Usage**

* Imagine a large piece of land that you barely use.
* Virtualization is like creating multiple plots on this land without physical separation. 
* This allows more people to utilize the land simultaneously.

**Virtual Machines in the Tech World**

* A physical server acts like the large piece of land. Traditionally, a server runs a single application, leaving most of its resources unused.
* Virtualization software, called a hypervisor, creates virtual machines on a single physical server.
* Each virtual machine acts like a separate plot, running its own operating system and applications.
* This allows for efficient utilization of the server's resources.

**Key Points About Virtual Machines**

* Created using a hypervisor software.
* Logical partitions on a physical server, not separate machines.
* Improve server resource efficiency.
* Cloud providers like Amazon Web Services (AWS) use VMs to deliver computing resources.
* Software programs like Oracle VirtualBox allow creating VMs on your personal laptop.

**Benefits of Using Virtual Machines**

* **Improved Efficiency:** Get more use out of a single physical server by running multiple virtual machines.
* **Cost Savings:** Consolidate applications onto a single server, potentially reducing hardware costs.
* **Increased Flexibility:** Easily create, destroy, and move virtual machines around for better resource provisioning and management.
