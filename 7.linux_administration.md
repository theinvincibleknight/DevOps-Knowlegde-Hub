## Linux Administration

### What is an Operating System?

* An operating system acts as a bridge between the software applications you use and the hardware components of your computer.
* It allows software to communicate with the hardware and vice versa.
* Common operating systems include Windows, macOS, and Linux.

### Why is Linux Popular?

* Linux is a free and open-source operating system, unlike Windows which is a paid and proprietary operating system.
* Because it’s open-source, anyone can modify and distribute Linux.
