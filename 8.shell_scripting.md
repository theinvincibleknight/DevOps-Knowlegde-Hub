## Shell Scripting

**What is Shell Scripting?**

* Shell scripting involves writing a series of commands that the shell can execute one after another.
* It automates tasks you would typically perform manually in the terminal.
* Bash is the default shell on most Linux distributions.

**Benefits of Shell Scripting**

* **Automation:** Automate repetitive tasks, saving time and effort.
* **Reduced Errors:** Scripts can perform tasks consistently, minimizing human error.
* **Improved Readability:** Complex tasks can be documented and understood more easily with scripts.
* **Increased Efficiency:** Scripts can streamline workflows and improve overall efficiency.

**Creating a Shell Script**

1. **Text Editor:** Use a text editor like `nano` or `vi` to create a new file with a `.sh` extension (e.g., `myscript.sh`).
2. **Shebang Line:**  Start the script with a shebang line (e.g., `#!/bin/bash`) to specify the interpreter that will execute the script.

    Some people use different executables such as `dash`, `ksh`, `sh`, etc. Shell script syntax may vary as per these execuatables. Most commonly used is `bash`. Hence we use `#!/bin/bash`.

3. **Shell Commands:** Add your shell commands within the script file.
4. **Permissions:** Make the script executable using the `chmod` command: 
   ```bash
   chmod +x myscript.sh
   ```

**Running a Shell Script**

1. **Navigate:** Use the `cd` command to navigate to the directory containing your script.
2. **Execute:** Run the script using its filename:
   ```bash
   ./myscript.sh
   ```

**Examples:** <br>
- Use `echo`, whenever you want to **print** something.
- Any shell scripts can be execuated using .`/script.sh` or `sh script.sh`. They should have execute permission.

**Shell Script Example (Printing System Information)**

```bash
#!/bin/bash

echo "System Information Script"
echo "Hostname: $(hostname)"
echo "Operating System: $(uname -o)"
echo "Kernel Version: $(uname -r)"
echo "Uptime: $(uptime -p)"
echo "Free Memory: $(free -m | grep Mem: | awk '{print $2}') MB"
echo "Number of CPUs: $(nproc)"

echo "Script execution completed."
```

**Explanation of the Script**

* The script starts with the shebang line `#!/bin/bash`.
* It uses various commands like `hostname`, `uname`, `uptime`, and `free` to gather system information.
* `awk` is used to extract the second column (free memory) from the output of the `free` command.
* The script outputs the information to the terminal with clear labels.
