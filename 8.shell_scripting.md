## Shell Scripting

**What is Shell Scripting?**

* Shell scripting involves writing a series of commands that the shell can execute one after another.
* It automates tasks you would typically perform manually in the terminal.
* Bash is the default shell on most Linux distributions.

**Benefits of Shell Scripting**

* **Automation:** Automate repetitive tasks, saving time and effort.
* **Reduced Errors:** Scripts can perform tasks consistently, minimizing human error.
* **Improved Readability:** Complex tasks can be documented and understood more easily with scripts.
* **Increased Efficiency:** Scripts can streamline workflows and improve overall efficiency.

**Creating a Shell Script**

1. **Text Editor:** Use a text editor like `nano` or `vi` to create a new file with a `.sh` extension (e.g., `myscript.sh`).
2. **Shebang Line:**  Start the script with a shebang line (e.g., `#!/bin/bash`) to specify the interpreter that will execute the script.

    Some people use different executables such as `dash`, `ksh`, `sh`, etc. Shell script syntax may vary as per these execuatables. Most commonly used is `bash`. Hence we use `#!/bin/bash`.

3. **Shell Commands:** Add your shell commands within the script file.
4. **Permissions:** Make the script executable using the `chmod` command: 
   ```bash
   chmod +x myscript.sh
   ```

**Running a Shell Script**

1. **Navigate:** Use the `cd` command to navigate to the directory containing your script.
2. **Execute:** Run the script using its filename:
   ```bash
   ./myscript.sh
   ```

### Shell Scripting and Linux Commands

#### Printing Output

- Use `echo` whenever you want to print something.

#### Executing Shell Scripts

- Shell scripts can be executed using `./script.sh` or `sh script.sh`. Ensure the script has execute permissions.

#### Process Management

- Use `ps -ef` to view details of all processes running in the system.

#### Pipelines and Channels

- Use `|` to pass the output of one command to another.
- Example: `ps -ef | grep -i "python"` filters processes containing "python" regardless of case due to use of `-i` along with `grep`.

#### Channels in Operating System

- Operating systems have different channels:
  - `stdin`, `stdout`, `stderr`.
- Example: Output of `date` command goes to `stdout`. Pipes (`|`) can't redirect output from `stdin`.

#### Filtering Output

- Use `grep` to filter output.
- Use `awk` to filter specific columns from output.
- Example: `ps -ef | grep "amazon" | awk -F" " '{print $2}'` filters and prints the 2nd column of processes containing "amazon".

#### Best Practices in Bash Scripts

- Use `set -x` for debugging.
- Use `set -e` to exit on error.
- To handle errors with pipelines, use `set -eo pipefail`.

    You can also append all these in one line like `set -exo pipefail`. But not recommonded for troubleshooting.

#### Fetching and Handling Logs

- Use `curl` to fetch and filter logs from a URL.
- Example: `curl link_to_logfile | grep -i "error"` fetches and filters logs for the word "error".

- Use `wget` to download files to your system.
- `curl` can directly load data without downloading.

#### File Management

- Use `find` to locate files in your system.
- Example: `find / -name pam` searches for files named "pam" starting from root (`/`).

#### User Management

- Switch to root user with `sudo su -`. (substitute user do switch user)
- Switch to another user with `su - username`.

#### Signals in Linux

- Linux terminal uses signals (`SIGINT`, `SIGKILL`, `SIGSYS`) to manage process execution.
- Example: `trap 'echo "Script interrupted. Exiting..." ; exit 1' SIGINT` traps interrupt signal `SIGINT` which is `Ctrl+C`.

### Statements in Bash scripting

#### 1. `if-else` Statement

#### Syntax:
```bash
if condition
then
    # commands if condition is true
else
    # commands if condition is false
fi
```

#### Example:
```bash
#!/bin/bash

# Example: Check if a number is positive or negative

echo "Enter a number: "
read num

if [ $num -gt 0 ]; then
    echo "Number is positive."
else
    echo "Number is zero or negative."
fi
```

#### 2. `for` Loop

#### Syntax:
```bash
for item in list
do
    # commands using $item
done
```

#### Example:
```bash
#!/bin/bash

# Example: Print numbers from 1 to 5

for num in 1 2 3 4 5
do
    echo "Number: $num"
done
```

#### 3. `while` Loop

#### Syntax:
```bash
while condition
do
    # commands as long as condition is true
done
```

#### Example:
```bash
#!/bin/bash

# Example: Print numbers from 1 to 5 using a while loop

num=1
while [ $num -le 5 ]
do
    echo "Number: $num"
    ((num++))
done
```

#### 4. `until` Loop

#### Syntax:
```bash
until condition
do
    # commands until condition becomes true
done
```

#### Example:
```bash
#!/bin/bash

# Example: Print numbers from 1 to 5 using an until loop

num=1
until [ $num -gt 5 ]
do
    echo "Number: $num"
    ((num++))
done
```

#### 5. `select` Statement

#### Syntax:
```bash
select variable in list
do
    # commands using $variable
done
```

#### Example:
```bash
#!/bin/bash

# Example: Select a fruit from a list

echo "Select your favorite fruit:"
select fruit in Apple Orange Banana Grape Exit
do
    case $fruit in
        Apple)
            echo "You chose Apple."
            ;;
        Orange)
            echo "You chose Orange."
            ;;
        Banana)
            echo "You chose Banana."
            ;;
        Grape)
            echo "You chose Grape."
            ;;
        Exit)
            echo "Exiting."
            break
            ;;
        *)
            echo "Invalid option."
            ;;
    esac
done
```

**Shell Script Example (Printing System Information)**

```bash
#!/bin/bash

echo "System Information Script"
echo "Hostname: $(hostname)"
echo "Operating System: $(uname -o)"
echo "Kernel Version: $(uname -r)"
echo "Uptime: $(uptime -p)"
echo "Free Memory: $(free -m | grep Mem: | awk '{print $2}') MB"
echo "Number of CPUs: $(nproc)"

echo "Script execution completed."
```

**Explanation of the Script**

* The script starts with the shebang line `#!/bin/bash`.
* It uses various commands like `hostname`, `uname`, `uptime`, and `free` to gather system information.
* `awk` is used to extract the second column (free memory) from the output of the `free` command.
* The script outputs the information to the terminal with clear labels.

**Improving a Shell Script**

1. **Metadata:**
    * Include comments at the beginning of your script with details like author, creation date, purpose, version, and prerequisites.
    * Example:

    ```bash
    #!/bin/bash

    # Script: system_info.sh
    # Author: John Doe
    # Created: 2023-06-24
    # Purpose: Collects and displays basic system information.
    ```

2. **Shebang Line:**
    * The first line should always be the shebang line specifying the interpreter.
    * Example:

    ```bash
    #!/bin/bash
    ```

3. **Error Handling:**
    * Use `set -e` at the beginning to make the script exit on errors.
    * Example:

    ```bash
    #!/bin/bash

    set -e  # Exit on encountering errors

    echo "System Information Script"
    # ... rest of your commands ...
    ```

4. **Readability with `echo` Statements:**
    * Use `echo` statements to explain the information being displayed.
    * Example:

    ```bash
    #!/bin/bash

    echo "Free Memory:"
    free -m | grep Mem: | awk '{print $2}' MB
    ```

5. **Debugging with `set -x` (Alternative):**
    * Use `set -x` for debugging to print each executed line and its output.
    * **Note:** This is primarily for debugging purposes and not recommended for production scripts due to verbosity.

6. **Signal Trapping with `trap`:**
    * Use `trap` to define actions for specific signals (e.g., `SIGINT` for Ctrl+C).
    * Example (basic structure):

    ```bash
    trap 'echo "Script interrupted. Exiting..." ; exit 1' SIGINT
    ```

    * This example will print a message and exit with an exit code of 1 when interrupted with Ctrl+C.

7. **Downloading Logs with `curl`:**
    * Use `curl` to download logs from external storage.
    * Example (download a file from a URL and save it locally):

    ```bash
    curl -o logfile.txt https://storage.example.com/logs/system.log
    ```
