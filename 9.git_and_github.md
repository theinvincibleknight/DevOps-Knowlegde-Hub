## Git and GitHub

**Introduction**

* **Version Control System (VCS):** A system that tracks changes made to files over time. 
* **Benefits of VCS:**
    * Revert to previous versions of code if needed.
    * Collaborate effectively with other developers on the same project.

**What is Git?**

* A Distributed Version Control System (DVCS), meaning a complete copy of the project history is stored on each developer's machine.
* This differs from centralized systems like Subversion (SVN) where changes are committed to a central server.

**Why Use Git?**

* **Track changes** in your codebase.
* **Revert** to previous stable versions if needed.
* **Collaborate** with other developers seamlessly.
* **Maintain a secure** version history of your project.

**Git Basics**

* **Git Repository (Repo):** A directory containing the entire project's history (files and version history).
* **Working Directory:** A local copy of the files from the repository you're currently working on.
* **Staging Area:** A temporary area to store changes you plan to commit to the repository.

**Introduction to GitHub**

* A popular web-based Git repository hosting platform.
* Offers version control in the cloud for accessibility from anywhere.
* Provides collaboration features like issue tracking and pull requests.

**Using GitHub**

* Create a GitHub account.
* Create a new repository on GitHub.
* Clone a repository from GitHub to your local machine:
    * **`git clone <url>`** (URL points to the remote repository on GitHub).

### **Git Commands**

**SETUP** <br>
Configuring user information used across all local repositories

* `git config --global user.name “[firstname lastname]”` <br>
set a name that is identifiable for credit when review version history.
* `git config --global user.email “[valid-email]”` <br>
set an email address that will be associated with each history marker
* `git config --global color.ui auto` <br>
set automatic command line coloring for Git for easy reviewing
* `git config --list` <br>
to list what we have configured in users

**SETUP & INIT** <br>
Configuring user information, initializing and cloning repositories

* `git init` <br>
initialize an existing directory as a Git repository
* `git clone [url]` <br>

**BRANCH & MERGE** <br>
Isolating work in branches, changing context, and integrating changes

* `git branch`
list your branches. a * will appear next to the currently active branch
* `git branch [branch-name]`
create a new branch at the current commit
* `git checkout`
switch to another branch and check it out into your working directory
* `git merge [branch]`

* `git diff branchB...branchA` <br>
show the diff of what is in branchA that is not in branchB
* `git show [SHA]` <br>
show any object in Git in human-readable format

**TRACKING PATH CHANGES** <br>
Versioning file removes and path changes

* `git rm [file]` <br>

**IGNORING PATTERNS** <br>
Preventing unintentional staging or commiting of files

* `.gitignore`
```
logs/
*.notes
pattern*/
```
Save a file with desired patterns as `.gitignore` with either direct string matches or wildcard globs.
* `git config --global core.excludesfile [file]` <br>
system wide ignore pattern for all local repositories

**SHARE & UPDATE** <br>
Retrieving updates from another repository and updating local repos

* `git remote add [alias] [url]` <br>
add a git URL as an alias

list stack-order of stashed file changes
* `git stash pop` <br>
write working from top of stash stack
* `git stash drop` <br>
discard the changes from top of stash stack

### **Basics:**

#### Basic Git Workflow

- When changes are made in a Git-initialized folder:
  - `git status` shows:
    - **Modified** for changed files.
    - **Untracked** for new files.
- Adding files:
  - Use `git add <filename>` to stage files.
  - Staged files are ready for commit.
- Committing changes:
  - `git commit -m "commit message"` commits changes.
  - `git status` shows unchanged after commit.

#### Example Workflow

- Starting a project and pushing to GitHub:
  1. `git init`: Initialize a new Git repository.
  2. `git add .`: Stage all files in the folder.
  3. `git commit -m "commit message"`: Commit staged files.
  4. `git status`: Verify all changes are committed.
  5. `git remote add origin <git repo link>`: Set GitHub repository as remote.
  6. `git remote -v`: Verify remote repository.
  7. `git branch`: Check current branch.
  8. `git branch -M main`: Rename branch from master to main.
  9. `git push -u origin main`: Push changes to main repository.

#### Local Git Workflow

- GitHub Repo -> Clone to Local system -> Make changes -> Add -> Commit -> Push

#### Branch Commands

- Managing branches:
  - `git branch`: Check current branch.
  - `git branch -M main`: Rename current branch.
  - `git checkout <branch_name>`: Switch to another branch.
  - `git checkout -b <new_branch_name>`: Create and switch to a new branch.
  - `git branch -d <branch_name>`: Delete a branch (not current branch. You can't delete the branch you are already in, you need to checkout to other branch and then delete)

#### Remote Repository

- **Remote Repository:** A copy of the Git repository hosted on a server (e.g., GitHub).
- **Pushing and Pulling Changes:**
    * **`git push origin <branch_name>`**: Pushes local commits to a remote branch on a hosting platform like GitHub.
    * **`git pull origin <branch_name>`**: Pulls changes from a remote branch to your local repository, keeping your local version up-to-date.

#### Merging Branches

- **Merging Branches**:
  - Method 1:
    - `git diff <branch_name>`: Compare commits, branches, files, etc.
    - `git merge <branch_name>`: Merge two branches.
  - Method 2:
    - Create a Pull Request using GitHub.

**Pull Request:** It lets you tell others about changes you've pushed to a branch in a repository on GitHub. When you create a pull request, a senior can review the PR and decide to accept or reject.

#### Resolving Merge Conflicts

- **Merge Conflicts:**
An event that takes place when Git is unable to automatically resolve differences in code between two commits.

- **Undoing Changes**
    - **Case 1: staged changes** (Changes that are added but not commited)
        - `git reset ‹- file name ->`
        - `git reset`
    - **Case 2: commited changes** (for one commit)
        - `git reset HEAD~1`
    - **Case 3: commited changes** (for many commits)
        - `git reset ‹- commit hash ->`
You will get the commit hash value using `git log` command, copy the hash of commit till where you want to reset and use it with above command, it will reset all commits before this hash.
        - `git reset --hard ‹- commit hash ->`
"--hard" Reset including editor changes.

#### Fork

- A fork is a new repository that shares code and visibility settings with the original "upstream" repository.
- Fork is a rough copy. Allows independent development while retaining connection to the original.

### **Git and GitHub: Additional Explanation**

Once Git is installed, you can check the version using

```bash
git --version
```

**Configure Git with Username and Email:**

Configure username and email using the following commands:
```bash
$ git config --global user.name "Paul Philips"
$ git config --global user.email paulphilips@email.com
```
To check the configured username and email:
```bash
$ git config --list
```

**Creating a Git Repository:**

A Git repository (repo) is where all your files will be tracked by Git. Navigate to the folder where you have your files or where you are going to create new files, and type `git init`.
```bash
$ cd code/
$ git init
```
This initializes the folder as a Git repository and creates a hidden directory named `.git` inside this folder.

```bash
$ ls -a
. .. .git
```
You can create a sample file inside this folder. Here, we are creating **index.html** as an example.

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <title>Document</title>
</head>
<body>
    
</body>
</html>
```
You can mark this file as **version_1.0** using `git commit`.

**Git Add and Git Commit:**

Type `git status` to check which files are tracked, untracked, etc.

```bash
$ git status
On branch master

No commits yet

Untracked files:
  (use "git add <file>..." to include in what will be committed)
        index.html
nothing added to commit but untracked files present (use "git add" to track)
$
```
Add untracked files to the tracked files using the `git add` command. This brings the files to the **staging area** and makes them ready to commit.

You can add a particular file by specifying its name: `git add <file1> <file2>`
```bash
$ git add index.html
```
If you want to track all the files inside the Git repo, you can use `.` or `*`.
```bash
$ git add .
```
Now check the status again. Files are in the staging area and ready to be committed.

```bash
$ git status
On branch master

No commits yet

Changes to be committed:
  (use "git rm --cached <file>..." to unstage)
        new file:   index.html
```
Note: If you make any changes to a file after adding it to the staging area, you need to use `git add` again before committing it.

A Git commit captures a snapshot of the project's currently staged changes, creating a permanent record in the repository's history.

To commit the file, use `git commit -m "<message>"`. Describe your changes briefly for easy understanding.

```bash
$ git commit -m "version 1 of index.html"
[master (root-commit) 58258db] version 1 of index.html
 1 file changed, 15 insertions(+)
 create mode 100644 index.html
```
You can check the history of commits using `git log`.

```bash
$ git log 
commit 58258db3512585f2a0506e29c615bf2344d5b95 (HEAD -> master)
Author: Paul Philips <paulphilips@email.com>
Date: Sun Apr 21 13:11:49 2024 +0300

    version 1 of index.html
$
```
You can see the commit message, commit hash (a unique identifier for the commit), author information, branch name, and the date and time of the commit.

If you make changes or updates to **index.html** and run `git status`, you will see that the file has been modified.

```bash
$ git status
On branch master
Changes not staged for commit:
  (use "git add <file>..." to update what will be committed)
  (use "git restore <file>..." to discard changes in working directory)
        modified:   index.html
no changes added to commit (use "git add" and/or "git commit -a")
```

To see what modifications have been made, use `git diff`. This compares the modifications with the committed file and shows the changes.

```bash
$ git diff 
diff --git a/index.html b/index.html
index b138f08..9b419c5 100644
--- a/index.html
+++ b/index.html
@@ -9,7 +9,7 @@
</head>
<body>
ー
+ <h1>This is version 2</h1>
</body>

</html>
\ No newline at end of file
$ 
```
You need to use `git add` and `git commit` to commit the changes and keep track of each change. After making multiple changes and commits to the file, your `git log` will contain multiple records of commits.

```bash
$ git log
commit e26853364ddf6b81c0ca013e8134118a9136297b (HEAD -> master)
Author: Paul Philips <paulphilips@email.com>
Date: Sun Apr 21 13:33:24 2024 +0300

    This is version 3

commit ee295d4fec6c5a78629a638f5d6cdb92dfff88a5
Author: Paul Philips <paulphilips@email.com>
Date: Sun Apr 21 13:31:29 2024 +0300

    This is version 2

commit 58258db3512585f2a0506e29c615bf2344d5b95
Author: Paul Philips <paulphilips@email.com>
Date: Sun Apr 21 13:11:49 2024 +0300

    First version 1 of index.html
$ 
```
**View Files from an Old Commit:**

If you're currently on the third commit and, for some reason, you want to view the file as it was in the first commit, use `git log` to get the commit history, copy the **commit ID** of the commit you want to view, and use it with `git show`. Specify the filename after the commit ID using `:`.

```bash
$ git show 58258db3512585f2a0506e29c615bf2344d5b95:index.html
```

This is not feasible for multiple files or if the file is very large. In such cases, you can use `git checkout`.

**Retrieve an Old Version with Git Checkout:**

To use `git checkout`, you also need the commit ID, which you get from `git log`. This command displays the older version of the file directly in the main file itself, allowing you to view the older version in context.

Specify which file you want from this commit using the filename or to retrieve all files from that commit, use `*`.
```bash
$ git checkout 58258db3512585f2a0506e29c615bf2344d5b95 -- *
```
Once you're done checking the older version and want to return to the latest version, checkout the current branch directly.

```bash
$ git checkout master -- *
```
---
**Working with Git Restore and Git Reset**

There may be multiple negative cases, where you want to restore the file its previous version and undo all the changes done.

<u>Some Negative Test Cases:</u>

If we made any change by mistake and saved it

- Case1: To undo changes, get the last successful change. <br>
git restore . or filename (. mean all files)

```
$ git restore .
```

This will undo all the changes done to the file in **unstaged area**.

- Case2: If we added the changes using git add then.. <br>
git restore --staged <file_path>  #To unstage <br>
git restore <file_path>  #To discard changes in the working directory.
```
$ git restore --staged .
$ git restore .
```
By doing `restore --staged`, we have just undo `git add`, we are bringing the file from **staged area** to **unstaged area**. Now once the file is unstaged, you can use `git restore .`.

- Case3: Added changes to staging area (didn't commit) after this added more changes to file <br>
//To get the staged changes <br>
git restore --worktree index.html

After doing the required changes, we have added the files. And were ready to commit, but before that again did some changes to the file, which is not required. When we do `git status`, we see two status one is in staged area and one in unstaged area.

```
$ git status
On branch master
Changes to be committed:
    (use "git restore -staged <file>..." to unstage)
          modified: index.html

Changes not staged for commit:
    (use "git add <file>..." to update what will be committed)
    (use "git restore <file>..." to discard changes in working directory)
          modified: index.html
$
```

Now to restore the only staged changes and undo unstaged changes, we use `git restore --worktree`.

```
git restore --worktree .
```
Now only staged changes will be available and ready to commit.

- Case4: How about if we did commit also wrong files <br>
git reset --soft HEAD^ (uncommit and keep the changes) <br>
git reset --hard HEAD^ (uncommit and discard the changes)

If you commit wrong file by mistake, you can use `git reset` to uncommit it.

```
$ git reset —-hard HEAD^
HEAD is now at 8d3f141 V4
```
Using `HEAD^` you have gone one commit back, it basically undo the last commit. You can also verify the same in commit history using `git log`.
