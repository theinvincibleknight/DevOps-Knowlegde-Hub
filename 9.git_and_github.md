## Git and GitHub

**Introduction**

* **Version Control System (VCS):** A system that tracks changes made to files over time. 
* **Benefits of VCS:**
    * Revert to previous versions of code if needed.
    * Collaborate effectively with other developers on the same project.

**What is Git?**

* A Distributed Version Control System (DVCS), meaning a complete copy of the project history is stored on each developer's machine.
* This differs from centralized systems like Subversion (SVN) where changes are committed to a central server.

**Why Use Git?**

* **Track changes** in your codebase.
* **Revert** to previous stable versions if needed.
* **Collaborate** with other developers seamlessly.
* **Maintain a secure** version history of your project.

**Git Basics**

* **Git Repository (Repo):** A directory containing the entire project's history (files and version history).
* **Working Directory:** A local copy of the files from the repository you're currently working on.
* **Staging Area:** A temporary area to store changes you plan to commit to the repository.

**Introduction to GitHub**

* A popular web-based Git repository hosting platform.
* Offers version control in the cloud for accessibility from anywhere.
* Provides collaboration features like issue tracking and pull requests.

**Using GitHub**

* Create a GitHub account.
* Create a new repository on GitHub.
* Clone a repository from GitHub to your local machine:
    * **`git clone <url>`** (URL points to the remote repository on GitHub).

### **Git Commands**

**SETUP** <br>
Configuring user information used across all local repositories

* `git config --global user.name “[firstname lastname]”` <br>
set a name that is identifiable for credit when review version history.
* `git config --global user.email “[valid-email]”` <br>
set an email address that will be associated with each history marker
* `git config --global color.ui auto` <br>
set automatic command line coloring for Git for easy reviewing
* `git config --list` <br>
to list what we have configured in users

**SETUP & INIT** <br>
Configuring user information, initializing and cloning repositories

* `git init` <br>
initialize an existing directory as a Git repository
* `git clone [url]` <br>
retrieve an entire repository from a hosted location via URL

**STAGE & SNAPSHOT** <br>
Working with snapshots and the Git staging area

* `git status` <br>
show modified files in working directory, staged for your next commit
* `git add [file]` <br>
add a file as it looks now to your next commit (stage)
* `git reset [file]` <br>
unstage a file while retaining the changes in working directory
* `git diff` <br>
diff of what is changed but not staged
* `git diff --staged` <br>
diff of what is staged but not yet committed
* `git commit -m “[descriptive message]”` <br>
commit your staged content as a new commit snapshot

**BRANCH & MERGE** <br>
Isolating work in branches, changing context, and integrating changes

* `git branch`
list your branches. a * will appear next to the currently active branch
* `git branch [branch-name]`
create a new branch at the current commit
* `git checkout`
switch to another branch and check it out into your working directory
* `git merge [branch]`
merge the specified branch’s history into the current one
* `git log`
show all commits in the current branch’s history

**INSPECT & COMPARE** <br>
Examining logs, diffs and object information

* `git log` <br>
show the commit history for the currently active branch
* `git log branchB..branchA` <br>
show the commits on branchA that are not on branchB
* `git log --follow [file]` <br>
show the commits that changed file, even across renames
* `git diff branchB...branchA` <br>
show the diff of what is in branchA that is not in branchB
* `git show [SHA]` <br>
show any object in Git in human-readable format

**TRACKING PATH CHANGES** <br>
Versioning file removes and path changes

* `git rm [file]` <br>
delete the file from project and stage the removal for commit
* `git mv [existing-path] [new-path]` <br>
change an existing file path and stage the move
* `git log --stat -M` <br>
show all commit logs with indication of any paths that moved

**IGNORING PATTERNS** <br>
Preventing unintentional staging or commiting of files

* `.gitignore`
```
logs/
*.notes
pattern*/
```
Save a file with desired patterns as `.gitignore` with either direct string matches or wildcard globs.
* `git config --global core.excludesfile [file]` <br>
system wide ignore pattern for all local repositories

**SHARE & UPDATE** <br>
Retrieving updates from another repository and updating local repos

* `git remote add [alias] [url]` <br>
add a git URL as an alias
* `git fetch [alias]` <br>
fetch down all the branches from that Git remote
* `git merge [alias]/[branch]` <br>
merge a remote branch into your current branch to bring it up to date
* `git push [alias] [branch]` <br>
Transmit local branch commits to the remote repository branch
* `git pull` <br>
fetch and merge any commits from the tracking remote branch

**REWRITE HISTORY** <br>
Rewriting branches, updating commits and clearing history

* `git rebase [branch]` <br>
apply any commits of current branch ahead of specified one
* `git reset --hard [commit]` <br>
clear staging area, rewrite working tree from specified commit

**TEMPORARY COMMITS** <br>
Temporarily store modified, tracked files in order to change branches

* `git stash` <br>
Save modified and staged changes
* `git stash list` <br>
list stack-order of stashed file changes
* `git stash pop` <br>
write working from top of stash stack
* `git stash drop` <br>
discard the changes from top of stash stack

### **Additional Explanation:**

#### Basic Git Workflow

- When changes are made in a Git-initialized folder:
  - `git status` shows:
    - **Modified** for changed files.
    - **Untracked** for new files.
- Adding files:
  - Use `git add <filename>` to stage files.
  - Staged files are ready for commit.
- Committing changes:
  - `git commit -m "commit message"` commits changes.
  - `git status` shows unchanged after commit.

#### Example Workflow

- Starting a project and pushing to GitHub:
  1. `git init`: Initialize a new Git repository.
  2. `git add .`: Stage all files in the folder.
  3. `git commit -m "commit message"`: Commit staged files.
  4. `git status`: Verify all changes are committed.
  5. `git remote add origin <git repo link>`: Set GitHub repository as remote.
  6. `git remote -v`: Verify remote repository.
  7. `git branch`: Check current branch.
  8. `git branch -M main`: Rename branch from master to main.
  9. `git push -u origin main`: Push changes to main repository.

#### Local Git Workflow

- GitHub Repo -> Clone to Local system -> Make changes -> Add -> Commit -> Push

#### Branch Commands

- Managing branches:
  - `git branch`: Check current branch.
  - `git branch -M main`: Rename current branch.
  - `git checkout <branch_name>`: Switch to another branch.
  - `git checkout -b <new_branch_name>`: Create and switch to a new branch.
  - `git branch -d <branch_name>`: Delete a branch (not current branch. You can't delete the branch you are already in, you need to checkout to other branch and then delete)

#### Remote Repository

- **Remote Repository:** A copy of the Git repository hosted on a server (e.g., GitHub).
- **Pushing and Pulling Changes:**
    * **`git push origin <branch_name>`**: Pushes local commits to a remote branch on a hosting platform like GitHub.
    * **`git pull origin <branch_name>`**: Pulls changes from a remote branch to your local repository, keeping your local version up-to-date.

#### Merging Branches

- **Merging Branches**:
  - Method 1:
    - `git diff <branch_name>`: Compare commits, branches, files, etc.
    - `git merge <branch_name>`: Merge two branches.
  - Method 2:
    - Create a Pull Request using GitHub.

**Pull Request:** It lets you tell others about changes you've pushed to a branch in a repository on GitHub. When you create a pull request, a senior can review the PR and decide to accept or reject.

#### Resolving Merge Conflicts

- **Merge Conflicts:**
An event that takes place when Git is unable to automatically resolve differences in code between two commits.

- **Undoing Changes**
    - **Case 1: staged changes** (Changes that are added but not commited)
        - `git reset ‹- file name ->`
        - `git reset`
    - **Case 2: commited changes** (for one commit)
        - `git reset HEAD~1`
    - **Case 3: commited changes** (for many commits)
        - `git reset ‹- commit hash ->`
You will get the commit hash value using `git log` command, copy the hash of commit till where you want to reset and use it with above command, it will reset all commits before this hash.
        - `git reset --hard ‹- commit hash ->`
"--hard" Reset including editor changes.

#### Fork

- A fork is a new repository that shares code and visibility settings with the original "upstream" repository.
- Fork is a rough copy. Allows independent development while retaining connection to the original.
