## Introduction:

**What is DevOps?** <br>
- DevOps is a culture and practice that aims to improve the ability of an organization to deliver applications.
- Traditionally, there were separate teams for development, system administration, and build and release. This siloed approach made the delivery process slow and inefficient.
- DevOps breaks down these silos and encourages collaboration between developers, operations, and other teams. This collaboration helps to automate the delivery process, improve quality, and increase the speed of delivery.

**Four pillars of DevOps:**

1. **Automation**: Automating tasks such as building, testing, and deploying applications can help to improve efficiency and reduce errors.
2. **Quality**: DevOps emphasizes the importance of building quality into the application from the beginning. This includes things like code reviews, unit testing, and integration testing.
3. **Monitoring**: Continuously monitoring applications in production can help to identify and fix problems quickly.
4. **Testing**: Testing is an essential part of the DevOps process. There are many different types of testing, including unit testing, integration testing, and performance testing.

**How to introduce yourself in a DevOps interview?** <br>
When introducing yourself in a DevOps interview, you should explain your current experience in DevOps, your background, and the four pillars of DevOps (automation, quality, monitoring, and testing). You can also mention the tools and technologies you are familiar with, but this is not essential for beginners.
